          My name is Ava Mazzella, I grew up in the West Village surrounded by
          arts from the moment I could be. <br />
          I was drawn to creation and performance as a means to externally
          process the way I see the world. I make mostly paintings now, but
          that's very subject to change. <br />
          I live with my parents Jay and Jessica, + my cat, Mr. Whiskers. <br />
          the pic attached is from a photography program i did.. you'll hear
          more later

          I mostly work in acrylic paints, on canvas. I'm drawn to mixed
          abstract + portraiture/figure painting, and I use bright or heavily
          contrasting colors. I paint about social relationships, discomfort,
          and experiences. I also frequently include animals, such as fish or
          birds in many of my paintings, but that's lost on even me. <br />
          painting pictured to the right is called <em> Snowangels 2011</em>,
          one of my favorite paintings from this year
